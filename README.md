Use either technique to get the folder onto your local machine. Use whichever technique fits your workflow and comfort level.
If you clone or fork the repo, you'll only have to git pull every time you want changes. You will still have to manually "refresh" the extension to see the changes, explained later.

2. Visit chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer mode"
